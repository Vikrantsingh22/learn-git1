## Introduction

Version control is a crucial skill for software development, allowing you to track changes to your code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions. GitHub is a platform built around Git that makes it easy to collaborate and share your work.

## Getting Started

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine.
2. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one.

## Basic Git Commands

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone a repository from GitHub.
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "commit message"`: Commit staged changes.
- `git push origin <branch-name>`: Push changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull origin <branch-name>`: Pull changes from a remote repository.
- `git status`: View the status of your working directory.

## Creating Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make and commit your changes.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Create a pull request from your branch to the original repository.

## Feel free to contribute to this tutorial by creating pull requests and suggesting improvements! _ (make a pull request with a folder of ur name or something more fun )

## Collaborating with Others
